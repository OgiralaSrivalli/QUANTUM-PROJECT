# Quantum Job Tracker – AQVH Hackathon 2025

## 📌 Overview
Quantum Job Tracker is a hybrid quantum–classical application developed for the Amaravati Quantum Valley Hackathon 2025.  
The system integrates IBM Quantum APIs to fetch, analyze, and visualize completed quantum job data in real-time.

Our team secured **Top 2 position** in the internal hackathon and advanced to **AQVH 2025 semi-finals**.  
This project was developed under strict time constraints, showcasing rapid prototyping and teamwork.
